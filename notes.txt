---------------------------
Trying to see if using rhs or huss makes a difference to evolving theta
over 1901-2012. Differences at high latitudes in annual mean, but may not matter for vegetation.
Soil water 30-yr anomaly over 1901-2012 very similar with either huss or rhs. With rhs less increase in far north. So, use rhs for now as this does not seem to be related to any particular time in the day, so presumably is 24-hr.
Time for the run = 53 minutes. 4 minutes for 1st decade alone.
Next put in 8 soil layers and more detailed soil water movement.

Tuesday 27th September, 2016
----------------------------
Seems to be working with basic 8-layer soil. How long to spin-up? Do a test for a few points.
How long does a Sahara point, for example, take to lose all its soil water if it starts at capacity? Will need to add single-point and spin-up code wrappers. Use restarts as well.
Possible to use lon_s/lat_s and lon_c/lat_c to specify a small region for an interactive run? Promising...
Try...
HF:
lon_s = 
lat_s = 
counts = 1
Lower layer suddendly goes very low and then back up in three days. Why? Need shorter timestep? Well, f (nlayers) should be set to 0. Do that and run again.
OK, still problem as layer above goes to 0 water. Try shorter timestep: 30 minutes. That has definitely sorted it!
Have to change lat for reading as a_lat and b_lat wrong way up.
For HF, takes about 450 days to get there from theta_m.
How about Sahara desert? Takes about  from theta_s.
Say 0oW; 20oN. 0.42 to 0.26 after 10 yr. Same after another 10 yr, so maybe at equilirium? Looks like it.
And Cambridge: about 1600 days (4 yr). So, just assume OK within the first 10 yr of the century run. Do Century run now, global.

Wednesday
Seems to be working really well. Took 1 hr 54 mins for 1901-2012.
Put output in ayx_1.
Why soil water in great lakes? All points in GL have soil texture in hwsd file. What about theta files? Have values there as well. So need to sort this out. Look at actual lat and lon values. not good, so improving reading routines to account for lat_s etc.
OK, is a mystery. Great Lakes seem to have soil texture and theta values. Leave for now.

First decade now taking 500s (8.3 min) on processor 0, but 10 min on slurm. This means 112 yr should take 112 minutes (i.e. 1 h2 52 s).

1. Read through code and make nice for David.

Think I can remove f_inf. Do test of doing this in HF:
3652  0.3846186      0.0000000E+00
3652  0.3859738      0.0000000E+00
Different! Rounding error?
NISURF was not set. Now get:
3652  0.2813740

Re-do global run. Running now, but 15:49 for first decade. Why such a big increase in runtime?
NISURF = 48; runtime = 23:19
NISURF =  1; runtime = 19:25
So, not the actual computation that takes the time! Good! What is it? Switch off ayx netcdf outputs: 16:49. So doing very little but taking very long! Try stopping other things:
No climate reads: 3:14
just tas: 2:15
and ps: 4:23
and pr: 3:34
and rhs: 4:30
and huss: 4:49
So, what is going on?
Go back to 48 steps: 8:47 only!
Add back ayz writes: 20:21. So, most of time ayx outs. Great!
Fixed problem with fort.80 and new lat and lon to ayx outs.
Now time: 6:45! Really OK?
Now 8:48 for 10 yr and seems OK!
Fixed lon/lat coordinates in ayx files: 18:14
With two decades: 18:41, so only slightly longer!
Reverse lon/lat order in diagnostic array and see if map OK in panoply.

2. underground runoff
3. test for known location soil water through yr. where? HF?
4. plant growth

Friday 4th November, 2016
-------------------------
Was not running, but now seems fine. Was problem with memory. Now, first decade only taking 

Thursday 17th November, 2016
----------------------------
Set up GitHub to save and share H9.
Looking at how to do this here: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
Open Terminal applicaton on Darwin? Seems to work!
My name: adfriend45

Seemed to work:
git config --global user.name "adfriend45"
git config --global user.email "adf10@cam.ac.uk"
GitHub password: v...
Clone with HTTPS.
Using browser:
Next, Create a repository with readme.md
Added some content to readme.md

OK, I really do not understand how to use GitHub, especially the relationship between the command-line stuff and the browser stuff. Need to read until feel know it.

Using tried:
H9/SOURCE/git init
responded:
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/adf10/MODELS/H9/SOURCE/.git/

Now need to put the code in the repo I created before: adfriend45/HYBRID9
I assume this is 'push an existing repository from the command line'.
Trying:
H9/SOURCE/git remote add origin https://github.com/adfriend45/HYBRID9.git

OK, nothing happened, no error, not password request.
Next:
H9/SOURCE/git add --all
H9/SOURCE/git commit -m 'adding my files to my repository'
Did lots of stuff!
Now:
H9/SOURCE/git push -u origin master
Gives error. Forbidden.

Try again as new repository from command line:

Friday 21st November, 2016
---------------------------
Start with the simplest thing:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
Done, seems OK.
Now clone this to Darwin using method in
https://www.linux.com/learn/beginning-git-and-github-linux-users

git clone https://github.com/adfriend45/hello-world

Worked fine. Need to work out how to sync Darwin H9 code into GitHub next.
First, following the instructions on the last link in Darwin. checkout to make a new branch.

/home/adf10/git-repos/hello-world/git checkout -b test
git status
git add README.md
git commit README.md
git push origin test
failed! aha, problem we had before! Need to add my Darwin account as user to GitHub repository?

Looks like I need to change .git/config to use ssh:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7438313/pushing-to-git-returning-error-code-403-fatal-http-request-failed
and then need to add an SSH key for Darwin to my GitHub:
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/

Added a new SSH key on Darwin and put on my GitHub account. Passphrase to push from Darwin v... And works!

Now, set up for HYBRID9. Try pushing H9.f90 there:
H9/SOURCE/git add H9.f90
git commit H9.f90
git push origin HYBRID9
failed. Need to adjust .git/config as above. How make this general?

Monday 28th November, 2016
--------------------------
Work towards fully H9 on GitHub, with version updates and Annemarie and David joining in.
First, just do some playing with hello-world
Add some code here, and then move the code to Darwin, then update it on Darwin and put it back in GitHub.

Following required in HYBRID9 repo. on Darwin, in .git/config:
url=ssh://git@github.com/mynickname/my_repo.gits

All seems to be working well.
Runtime for global first decade: 00:09:15
Has it given some sensible output? Yes, seems fine!
So, next, add units to all variables.

Tuesday 29th November, 2016
---------------------------
Updating WRITE_NET_CDF_3DR.f90 to include units for data variables. Test using interactive run and panoply.
Works! Put on GitHub for just RNF units first, then do rest.
All data variable units now included in diagnostics.
Next?

(i) Soil texture, conductivity.
(ii) Slope.
(iii) Compute LAI and rooting depth.
(iv) Allow for use of MODIS LAI.
(v) Energy balance.
(vi) Stomatal control and C uptake.
(vii) Rings growth.

(i) At present hydraulic conductivities at layer interfaces is computed from xks, theta, and theta_s using Eqn. 7.89 of olesen13.
Need xks for each soil layer. Looks to be available from the same source as the saturated water contents we already have:
http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn/research/soil4d.jsp#download
listed as No. 4. 'Saturate hydraulic conductivity of FCH', cm/day.
Download and read into HYBRID9.f90 and check values for HF.
As had to register, download all datasets on this page to:
/home/DATA/BNU
Then put on Darwin and unzipped.
Also moved soils data to subd of /SOILS on scratch.
Before changing anything, save decade output in /save1
Changed file selection for soil properties to work as CASE.

Wednesday 30th November, 2016
-----------------------------
Saturated hydraulic conductivity file not being read. Need to make this work next. Values in native netCDF file look OK > range from 0.5 to 488.3 cm/day, with mean of 61.1 cm/day for top layer (i.e. 0.0071 mm/s; valued used at moment is 0.0038 mm/s, so of similar magnitude, which is encouraging).
k_s files are exactly twice the size of the theta_s files.
OK, so looks like it worked using '4' as the varid.
Using k_s.
New global simulation saved in save2. Some differences in soil water profiles evident.
Global soils data includes lambda, used to get B, so download this dataset and implement in code. 3-hr download so far!
OK, got it. Put on Darwin and implement in code.
Saved as /save3. Water in upper layers over Boreal region looks lower. Is everything OK? Reducing slope from 0.05 to 0.01 gets it back up to nice and high values, so need to gradually improve parameterisatios throughout.

Set swp_sat correctly. Get values from BNU and implement: psi. Taking forever to download (from China!). Got it, so implement now.

Done, saved in /save4. Odd things at lower soil layers in some areas. Need to check that next. Was not before these last changes...Occurred between /save2 and /save3, so is related to the implementation of lambda. Need to check that more carefully!

Thursday 1st December, 2016
---------------------------
On bike ride realised the problem with strong patterns in lower soil moisture appearing after implementing lambda may well be due to the time integration. Have a look at one point in Southern Africa, and see what values 1/lambda takes there.
Layer 7 is full of water and layer 8 empty during year 10 in the Kalahari desert at around 23 oW, 22 oS.
Solved going from NSURF = 96 to NSURF = 172. So, is an integration issue. This is a timestep of about 8 minutes. For interest, do a global run with this and see how long it takes. Took 00:20:35. Still some regions with problems, but reduced. Need to implement the equilibrium profile approach of Zeng & Decker (2009). Work that up once completed the theta_m implementation. Any other hydrology parameters need to be made geographically explicit? Yes, xkud!?

Meanwhile, how set theta_m? This is the residual water content of the soil, left after all flows cease at dry end. How used/set in CLM? Cannot see it there.

Compute theta_m as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_content defines the remaining water at high tension as 'Residual water content'. Assume this is the same as theta_m. Assume is hygroscopic water at -31 bar as in
http://www.napavalley.edu/people/ajohnson/Documents/VWT%20132%
!20Spring%202015/13%20-%20Basic%20Properties%20of%20Soil%20Water%20(171%
!20-%20203).pdf
The use:
http://lawr.ucdavis.edu/classes/ssc107/SSC107Syllabus/chapter2-00.pdf
to compute -31 bar in mm tension, and then invert equation for psi to give theta_m at -31 bar.

Runned globally and looks fine. Save as /save5.

Friday 2nd December, 2016
-------------------------
Added simple Zeng and Decker correction, and saved in /save6. Seems to have removed the oscillation, but absolute values are too low. Perhaps run again with no slope?

Thursday 8th December, 2016
---------------------------
Annemarie says some psi_s values are undefined. Need to check that out...
Add a diagnostic output of global psi_s values in each layer.
Will need a new subroutine to write a soil 3D diagnostic file on its own. Try and make it completely general.
Seems OK, but not general yet. psi_s looks OK.
Next, do a pull of all into new place and check all OK cf. AM's problem.

Wednesday 21st December, 2016
-----------------------------
Check everything is working still, and then work on the belowground runoff as AM is working on the water table/ZD correction.

Could not push, so try a pull first.

Both remote and local changed, so did following:
git commit HYBRID9.f90
git pull origin master

Seemed to work fine. Now local is same as master.
Then made changes locally, then:
git commite <changed files>
git push -u origin test
puts them in GitHub test branch,
then on GitHub merge these into master using 'Compare & pull request'
All seems OK, not try global run.

Only fully worked once pulled using:
git pull origin master
and then changing file and then
git commit HYBRID9.f90
and then
git push -u origin test
etc.

Global first decade took 11:07.
Ran, and soil water across layers, but somewhat patch near surface in cold places and deserts.

Now implement belowground runoff properly. How done in CLM?
TOPMODEL formulation. As I spent so much time doing this for HYBRID8, may as well implment in HYBRID9 as well.
First, try and get rid of patchy stuff. Remove ZD correction.
Still just as patchy - looks just the same. Leave for now.
Use Eqn. 7.168 for drainage.

Thursday 22nd December, 2016
----------------------------
Decided that as drainage requires water table depth, and the CLM method looks interesting, should try and develop that while AM looks at the modelE method, and we can then compare them. Also, as HYBRID9 looks rather patchy, I should develop an off-line versio for one point to test new parameterisations, before global runs. Will make analysis much easier. Need a piece of code to get local parameters and forcings from the global set first, and then use these as input, as well as the possibility of simpler input for generic testing, and other input from the site directly.

2017
Just test
